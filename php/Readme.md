# The PHP task

Tested in PHP 7.2

* The change_directory.php file contains the Path class
* The main.php contains a some test

Run with

`php main.py`

## Dev notes

* I keep the current path in an array
* The array gets modified by each component of the new path
* The current path attribute is a php magic method
